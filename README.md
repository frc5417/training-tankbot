# TankDrive Example
## Team 5417 | Programming Training

## Goal:
Our main goal for this repository was to teach our new programming team members how to code a robot using WPILib. We went step by step and followed all of our defined [best practices](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1n1fdhRA6_jub0nj2UY32rGamy-4-c_dchBl-OIQff6g/edit?usp=sharing) and made a robot able to run tank drive using four motor controllers.
